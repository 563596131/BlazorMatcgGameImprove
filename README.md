# BlazorMatcgGameImprove
 Improvements I plan to make:
1. Optional difficulty, the higher the difficulty, the bigger the board. 
2. All the cards are turned over, and the number of times you can only click to view the front is limited (indicating how many peek opportunities are left). But there is a cheat button, click once to randomly reveal an unpaired card, but it will also reduce the final score accordingly. 
3. The time becomes a countdown, and finally a score is given according to the remaining time, difficulty and the number of cheating times. 
4. Store each score once and display a leaderboard on the right side of the screen (refresh every time you open the app)

I think my improvement meets the ABC three needs. Changing the difficulty satisfies A and B, and the cards are memorized and the number of times is limited to satisfy A, B and C. Time turned into a countdown and scoring for the final grade fulfilled A's and B's. The storage score is to meet the A and C.

At present, I have implemented the countdown, and the rest of the functions are still in the design stage, but all the processes are progressing steadily. But I still need to study the files on LocalStorage.
